Answer to the question no.01;


var ,let and const are keyword of javascript that is use to declare of assign a value .

Here I discuss about some major difference between them.

var:- var is a type of keyword in js that is change able , that means we can do modify of change it . and also it is redeclare able keyword

example ;

var id=36;

id=37;

var id=38;


let:- let is a similar type of keyword in js , but let is different from var . 

we can change it the value of let , but we cannâ€™t redeclare the value o let , that is the difference from var.

example:

let id=36;

id=37;

let id=38;( it will be error)

const:- it is also similar types of keyword in js like var , const,

but it is totally different from var and little bit for const. 

major difference is , const is not change able or redeclareable;

that means the value of const is fixed;

example;

const id=36;

id=37;(error)

const id=38(error)#

Answer to the question no:2
map(), forEach(), and filter() are the method of , Javascript , mainly those are used to create new array with different condition;

now iam discuss about the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()

map(), is a method of javascript that is used to that create a new array 

by using new function to through each element of the main array . it cannot able to change it .

and it is return a new array ;

filter(), is a method of javascript that is used to create an new array ,

and it contain the value of orginal array and it will create when some condition will pass;

it does not change the old array, (orginall) n

 The forEach() method is an array method that go through  a provided
 
 function once for each element of an array. And it has no return value that means undefined ;

Answer to the question no:3

An arrow function is a shorter and easy  way to write functions 

in JavaScript introduced in ES6, using the => (arrow) syntax.

 It does not have its own this,parameter/ arguments, 
 
 or super, instead it takes them from the surrounding scope.
