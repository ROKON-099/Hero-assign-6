Answer to the question no.01;


var ,let and const are keyword of javascript that is use to declare of assign a value .

Here I discuss about some major difference between them.

var:- var is a type of keyword in js that is change able , that means we can do modify of change it . and also it is redeclare able keyword

example ;

var id=36;

id=37;

var id=38;


let:- let is a similar type of keyword in js , but let is different from var . 

we can change it the value of let , but we cannâ€™t redeclare the value o let , that is the difference from var.

example:

let id=36;

id=37;

let id=38;( it will be error)

const:- it is also similar types of keyword in js like var , const,

but it is totally different from var and little bit for const. 

major difference is , const is not change able or redeclareable;

that means the value of const is fixed;

example;

const id=36;

id=37;(error)

const id=38(error)
